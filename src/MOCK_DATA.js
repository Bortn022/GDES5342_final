The deliverables include 3 skews of 2 products (candles and room spray) and a display to be used at trade shows and company events. The goal was to create sophisticated and consistent branding across all designs. The labels were also designed with consideration for all types of interior styles so customers with all different decorating tastes could see the candles adding to the decor of their homes.",

To reflect the flow of the conversation, the spreads feature dynamic and experimental layouts that break up the text according to the audible pauses and change in speaker, with callouts to some of the important takeaways. The neutral color palette, sophisticated typefaces, and subtle pattern inspired by the folds of the brain compliments and presents the subject matter in a visually appealing manner.",

The goal was to create packaging for their pasta that expressed the legacy and origin of their business, but also stood out from major brands. The inspiration for this design revolves around Italian textiles as an homage to the origin of the business. The illustrative style brings an element of play not usually seen in other major pasta brands and is also highly repeatable for future skews. ",
